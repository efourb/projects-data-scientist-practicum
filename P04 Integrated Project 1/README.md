# Borrower Reliability Study

## Introduction for the Project 

A video game retailer has user and expert reviews, genre, console, and historical data on game sales available. It is needed to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not in order to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.

## Analysis results

* Prepared data
* Replaced column names
* Converted the data to the required types. Described in which columns the data type was replaced and why
* Handled gaps as needed
* Calculated the total sales in all regions and wrote them down in a separate column
* Conducted exploratory data analysis
* Analyzed how many games were released in different years
* Analyzed how sales changed by platform. Selected platforms with the highest total sales and plotted the distribution by years
* Identified which platforms are leading in sales, rising or falling. Selected several potentially profitable platforms
* Created a box-and-mustache chart of global game sales by platform. Described the result
* Checked how sales within one popular platform are influenced by user reviews and critics. Built a scatterplot and calculate the correlation between reviews and sales
* Analyzed the overall distribution of games by genre
* Compiled a portrait of the user of each region and determined for the user of each region (NA, EU, JP): the most popular platforms (top 5) and the most popular genres (top 5)
* Checked the hypotheses: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same;  average user ratings for Action and Sports are different
* Wrote a general conclusion
