# Data Science Projects

This repository is for projects prepared in the course of training in the Data Science Program by Practicum.

During this program I learned how to analyze large amounts of data and build models that help businesses make decisions, apply machine learning to predict events, estimate values and look for non-obvious patterns in data, and help business, industry and science create and improve products. 

I developed proficiency in Python, NLTK, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Keras, PySpark and other tools and libraries.
