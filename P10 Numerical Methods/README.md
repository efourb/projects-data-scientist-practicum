# Determining the cost of cars

## Introduction for the Project 

A used-car sales service is developing an app to attract new customers.
The app allows you to quickly find out the market value of your car. Having access to historical data, technical specifications, trim versions, and prices, a model to determine the value of a given car needs to be built.

## Analysis results

* Examined the data. Filled in missing values and handled anomalies in columns. Prepared samples for training models
* Trained different models, one of which is LightGBM. Tried different hyperparameters for each model
* Analyzed training time, prediction time and model quality
* Based on the criteria of the customer, chose the best model, checking its quality on a test sample
