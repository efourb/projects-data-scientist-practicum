# Comment classification model

## Introduction for the Project 

Project status: **Complete**

The online store launches a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. That is, clients propose their edits and comment on the changes of others. The store needs a tool that will look for toxic comments and submit them for moderation.
It is necessary to train the model to classify comments into positive and negative. There is a dataset with markup on the toxicity of edits.
