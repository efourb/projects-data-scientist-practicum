# Building a steel temperature prediction model

## Introduction for the Project 

In order to optimize production costs, the smelter factory decided to reduce electricity consumption during the steel processing stage. It is necessary to build a model that predicts the steel temperature.

## Analysis results

* Created a work plan.  Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the task list
* Clarified the tasks
* Designed the model
* Prepared a report
