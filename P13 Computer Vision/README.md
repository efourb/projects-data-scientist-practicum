# Buyer photo editing

## Introduction for the Project 

A supermarket chain would like to explore whether data science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage.
The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol. The task is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people’s age.

## Analysis results

* Looked at sample size
* Constructed a graph of the distribution of age in the sample
* Printed 10–15 photos on the screen and looked at how the dataset works
* Made conclusions about how the results of the study will affect the training of the model
* Trained the model in the GPU simulator and saved the result of the output of the model on the screen
* Analyzed the result of training the model
