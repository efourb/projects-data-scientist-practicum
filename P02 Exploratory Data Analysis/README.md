# Sale of apartments - analysis of the real estate market

## Introduction for the Project 

Project status: **Complete**

At my disposal was the data of the service for buying / selling apartments - an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in the city and neighboring settlements for several years. It is necessary to determine the market value of real estate. My job is to set the parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.
Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically on the basis of cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, airport, nearest park and reservoir.

## Analysis results

* Carried out data preprocessing
* Identified and studied missing values
* Filled in the blanks where appropriate
* Described why decided to fill in the gaps in these columns and how chose the values
* Indicated the reasons that could lead to gaps in the data
* Converted the data to the required types
* Calculated and added to the table: price per square meter; day of the week, month and year of publication of the announcement; floor of the apartment (first, last, other); the ratio of living and total area, as well as the ratio of kitchen area to total
* Conducted exploratory data analysis
* Studied the following parameters: area, price, number of rooms, ceiling height. Constructed histograms for each parameter
* Studied the time of sale of the apartment. Built a histogram. Calculate the mean and median. Described how long a sale usually takes
* Removed rare and outlier values. Describe what features are found
* Studied whether the price depends on the area, number of rooms, distance from the center. Studied the dependence of the price on which floor the apartment is located on: first, last or another. Also studied the dependence on the date of placement: day of the week, month and year
* Selected 10 settlements with the largest number of ads. Calculated the average price per square meter in these settlements. Highlighted the settlements with the highest and lowest cost of housing
* Studied offers of apartments. Built a graph that describes how the price depends on the distance from the center
* Highlighted a segment of apartments in the center. Analyzed this territory and study the following parameters: area, price, number of rooms, ceiling height. Also identified factors that affect the cost of an apartment (number of rooms, floor, distance from the center, date of placement of the ad)
* Formed a general conclusion
